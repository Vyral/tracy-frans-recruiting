Today I’m joined by Cody Levinson of Churchill Mortgage to talk about how we implement a couple key pieces of technology into our business to give our clients—in this case, homebuyers— a better overall experience.&nbsp;

First, an important way we speed up the home buying process and get to know our buyers is by getting them pre-approved, and **now we’re able to text them an app that speeds up the pre-approval process and gives us more insight into the mortgage field.&nbsp;**

Churchill developed this co-branded app to not only streamline the pre-approval process, but also to make the loan process accessible anywhere, anytime. We use this for both our millennial and senior homebuyers, and it’s been able to put keys in homes quicker.&nbsp;

A common question Realtors and the vendors they work with (especially loan officers) ask themselves is, “What do we do to buy leads? Do we spend money on Zillow and split that cost?” We’ve realized that once you start spending money on Zillow, though, you might never stop.&nbsp;

Well, **we’ve been able to take our Zillow users and convert them to our own app called Homescout.** Usually, about two weeks after using this app, they stop searching Zillow. It’s free, MLS-accessible, password-protected, and you can save and customize your home searches. It provides you with all sorts of data from various neighborhoods to help with your customization.&nbsp;

This app isn’t branded through our brokerage or Churchill Mortgage, so if we were to move, you could still use it for the next two or three years. Nobody is selling their leads, and you won’t see other agents on it. I have instant back-end monitoring of all users. I can see who’s clicked on their homes, offer them seller property disclosures, and keep their buying process going without having to reach out to them.&nbsp;

This insight has been tremendously beneficial, and it’s helped grow our business along with Churchill Mortgage. Partnering with a vendor who knows how to partner with technology not only increases our business, but it also provides a better experience to our clients.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about these apps or our vendor partnerships, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak to you.&nbsp;
