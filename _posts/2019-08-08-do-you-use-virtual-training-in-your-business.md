All agents agree that education is important, but what’s it doing for your business? How do you access that education?

**Virtual training is a major reason for our success.** As a tool, it provides plug-and-play, instantaneous education. Your education needs to be usable and attainable at any time, which is why we have weekly training sessions involving high-level real estate discussions that are recorded—so you can watch them whether it’s 9 a.m. or 9 p.m.&nbsp;

Another important way to implement education into your business is the dashboard. We love our dashboard recording. It gives us a 90-day out and a 120-day out. You have to know what’s going on in your business to make agile decisions on the run—not just for marketing and team growth, but also to serve your clients in the best way possible.&nbsp;

A big part of your education is also who you collaborate with. Is it someone local or national? We’ve enjoyed collaborating with agents who were at $5 million and looking to get to $8 million. Are you a team leader who’s at $10 million and wants to get to $20 million? Have you been in the industry for 40 years and are looking for your way out?

In any case, **you need the type of education that suits your business.** Don’t fall into the “one-education-fits-all” trap. Find people who will help you grow and do specifically what you’re looking to do in your business.&nbsp;

Zoom calls have also been very effective in bringing agents together on a national scale, for mastermind groups, continuing education, and giving and getting value from other countries and states experiencing tremendous success. **If you haven’t gotten into Zoom, just know that it’s the future of communication in our industry.** I challenge you to connect with Zoom because it will change your day and make you more efficient every day.&nbsp;

The power of virtual training is ready and waiting at your fingertips. The only question is, how high do you want to reach?&nbsp;

If you have any questions about implementing virtual training into your education, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to show you all the tools we use and work with you to help serve all of our clients to the highest degree. We look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;

And remember—never stop learning\!
