        <title>Providing Our Clients a Better Experience Through Technology</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaKo0p0JSus?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m joined by Cody Levinson of Churchill Mortgage to talk about how we implement a couple of key pieces of technology into our business to give our clients—in this case, homebuyers— a better overall experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, an important way we speed up the home buying process and get to know our buyers is by getting them pre-approved, and &lt;strong&gt;now we’re able to text them an app that speeds up the pre-approval process and gives us more insight into the mortgage field. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churchill developed this co-branded app to not only streamline the pre-approval process, but also to make the loan process accessible anywhere, anytime. We use this for both our millennial and senior homebuyers, and it’s been able to put keys in homes quicker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common question Realtors and the vendors they work with (especially loan officers) ask themselves is, “What do we do to buy leads? Do we spend money on Zillow and split that cost?” We’ve realized that once you start spending money on Zillow, though, you might never stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Partnering with a vendor who knows how to partner with technology not only increases our business, but it also provides a better experience to our clients.%20http://localhost:4000/providing-our-clients-a-better-experience-through-technology.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Partnering with a vendor who knows how to partner with technology not only increases our business, but it also provides a better experience to our clients.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;strong&gt;we’ve been able to take our Zillow users and convert them to our own app called Homescout.&lt;/strong&gt; Usually, about two weeks after using this app, they stop searching Zillow. It’s free, MLS-accessible, password-protected, and you can save and customize your home searches. It provides you with all sorts of data from various neighborhoods to help with your customization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app isn’t branded through our brokerage or Churchill Mortgage, so if we were to move, you could still use it for the next two or three years. Nobody is selling their leads, and you won’t see other agents on it. I have instant back-end monitoring of all users. I can see who’s clicked on their homes, offer them seller property disclosures, and keep their buying process going without having to reach out to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This insight has been tremendously beneficial, and it’s helped grow our business along with Churchill Mortgage. Partnering with a vendor who knows how to partner with technology not only increases our business, but it also provides a better experience to our clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about these apps or our vendor partnerships, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak to you. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Do You Use Virtual Training in Your Business?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwTeYKqWaqQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All agents agree that education is important, but what’s it doing for your business? How do you access that education?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual training is a major reason for our success.&lt;/strong&gt; As a tool, it provides plug-and-play, instantaneous education. Your education needs to be usable and attainable at any time, which is why we have weekly training sessions involving high-level real estate discussions that are recorded—so you can watch them whether it’s 9 a.m. or 9 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important way to implement education into your business is the dashboard. We love our dashboard recording. It gives us a 90-day out and a 120-day out. You have to know what’s going on in your business to make agile decisions on the run—not just for marketing and team growth, but also to serve your clients in the best way possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of your education is also who you collaborate with. Is it someone local or national? We’ve enjoyed collaborating with agents who were at $5 million and looking to get to $8 million. Are you a team leader who’s at $10 million and wants to get to $20 million? Have you been in the industry for 40 years and are looking for your way out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You have to know what’s going on in your business to make agile decisions on the run.%20http://localhost:4000/do-you-use-virtual-training-in-your-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You have to know what’s going on in your business to make agile decisions on the run.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, &lt;strong&gt;you need the type of education that suits your business.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t fall into the “one-education-fits-all” trap. Find people who will help you grow and do specifically what you’re looking to do in your business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom calls have also been very effective in bringing agents together on a national scale, for mastermind groups, continuing education, and giving and getting value from other countries and states experiencing tremendous success. &lt;strong&gt;If you haven’t gotten into Zoom, just know that it’s the future of communication in our industry.&lt;/strong&gt; I challenge you to connect with Zoom because it will change your day and make you more efficient every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of virtual training is ready and waiting at your fingertips. The only question is, how high do you want to reach? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about implementing virtual training into your education, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to show you all the tools we use and work with you to help serve all of our clients to the highest degree. We look forward to hearing from you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember—never stop learning!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Advantages Does a Cloud-Based Brokerage Have?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yLYMiC0DrSU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are basically only four business models that have ever existed in the real estate industry: local/traditional brokerages, national franchises, the boutique model, and cutting-edge cloud brokerage. A cloud-based brokerage represents a place where we can get together and work extremely efficiently along with our brokers, staff, and all agents with having the ability to work from anywhere. We’re paperless, but that’s one small part of being a cloud-based brokerage. We’ve increased our productivity while decreasing our operational costs. We’re able to get more help on our files more quickly than we ever could at a brokerage’s office. Most importantly, it’s allowed us to connect with top agents from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome To Our Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Omaha is a great and thriving market right now, but as every agent agrees, things are changing quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We couldn’t be more excited about these changes and opportunities. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we plan to upload two educational messages a month to give you insight into strategies and systems that will help your business thrive and how you, as an agent, can benefit from a business model that we have put into play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check back because content will be coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to keep you informed on how to promote your real estate career, and keep up with the constantly changing market!&lt;/p&gt;
