        <description>

There are basically only four business models that have ever existed in the real estate industry: local/traditional brokerages, national franchises, the boutique model, and our own cloud model. A cloud-based brokerage represents a place where we can get together and work extremely efficiently along with our brokers, staff, and all agents with having the ability to work from anywhere. We’re paperless, but that’s one small part of being a cloud-based brokerage. We’ve increased our productivity while decreasing our operational costs. We’re able to get more help on our files more quickly than we ever could at a brokerage’s office. Most importantly, it’s allowed us to connect with top agents from around the world.

        <description>Omaha is a great and thriving market right now, but as every agent agrees, things are changing quickly. 

We couldn’t be more excited about these changes and opportunities. 

So, we plan to upload two educational messages a month to give you insight into strategies and systems that will help your business thrive and how you, as an agent, can benefit from a business model that we have put into play. 

Check back because content will be coming soon!

We’re excited to keep you informed on how to promote your real estate career, and keep up with the constantly changing market!
